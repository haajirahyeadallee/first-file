        "\n",
        "##How It Happened\n",
        "It would have required to be initially written as a query in order to find the busiest time period. But after the query was sent, it had mistakes. It was tough to find a fix for the mistakes.\n",
        "##Preventation \n",
        "The answer was to build a query that used data from a range of dates to construct a graph instead. From this point on, it would be simpler to divide the code into two distinct plots, and pinpoint the busiest time of day.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Time Estimation\n",
        "It will take around ten minutes to rerun the query completely in order to correct the problem, plus an additional ten minutes to bring in any new needs."
